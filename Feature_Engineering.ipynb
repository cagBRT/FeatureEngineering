Well, while calculating the Z-score we re-scale and center the data and look for data points which are too far from zero. These data points which are way too far from zero will be treated as the outliers. In most of the cases a threshold of 3 or -3 is used i.e if the Z-score value is greater than or less than 3 or -3 respectively, that data point will be identified as outliers.\n",

        "Clearly, outliers with considerable leavarage can indicate a problem with the measurement or the data recording, communication or whatever. In *such* cases it is absolutely recommended to remove these values. But the judgement about this is based on reasons external to the data. Either the values are known to be \"impossible\" (e.g. recordings of a persons weight of 87653 kg [the mistake could be that the weight was wrongly given in grams] or the duration of a hostpital stay of more than 153 years and such). Other outlying but not-impossible values might be caused by special circumstances, like a disease study subject, the change of the operator (because the original operator was sick that day the suspect measurement was recorded), a power failure, something like this. But these resons have to be identified to know if the removal of the outlying value would improve the results or possible introduce bias. It may not alway be so easy to find the reasons, especially when looking at multivariate outliers."

Consider this situation as, you are the employer, the new salary update might be seen as biased and you might need to increase other employee’s salary too, to keep the balance.

It might be the reason for this, that dates can be present in numerous formats, which make it hard to understand by algorithms, even they are simplified to a format like \"01–01–2017\".\n",
